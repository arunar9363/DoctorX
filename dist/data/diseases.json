This inflammation makes the airways sensitive to various triggers, such as allergens, smoke, cold air, or exercise.

Transmitted by female *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes, it can cause a wide spectrum of illness, from a mild flu-like syndrome to a severe, potentially fatal condition called severe dengue (or dengue hemorrhagic fever). There are four distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus that cause dengue. Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that serotype but only temporary immunity against the others.",

It is an infection that damages the soft tissue of the gums and, if left untreated, can destroy the alveolar bone that supports the teeth. Periodontitis is typically caused by poor oral hygiene, which allows a sticky film of bacteria called plaque to build up and harden into tartar. This inflammation causes the gums to pull away from the teeth, forming pockets that become infected. As the disease progresses, the pockets deepen, and more bone and gum tissue are destroyed.",

When healthy, sinuses are filled with air, but when they become blocked and filled with fluid, germs (bacteria, viruses, or fungi) can grow and cause an infection. Common causes include the common cold, allergies (allergic rhinitis), or structural issues like a deviated septum.

    "description": "Thyroid disorders are conditions that affect the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck. The thyroid produces hormones that regulate the body's metabolism, controlling how the body uses energy. The two main types of thyroid disorders are hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), where the gland doesn't produce enough hormones, and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid), where it produces too much. These imbalances can affect everything from heart rate and body temperature to weight and mood. Thyroid issues are very common worldwide, especially among women.",

    "name": "Varicose Veins",
    "description": "Varicose veins are swollen, twisted veins that you can see just under the surface of the skin, most commonly in the legs. They occur when the one-way valves in the veins, which prevent blood from flowing backward, become weak or damaged. This allows blood to pool in the veins, causing them to stretch and enlarge. Risk factors include family history, older age, being female, pregnancy, obesity, and standing or sitting for long periods. While often considered a cosmetic issue, they can cause aching pain and discomfort and may lead to more serious problems like skin ulcers or blood clots.",

It is often caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, but it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain. The most common causes include Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, and vestibular neuritis (inflammation of the vestibular nerve).

    "description": "Vitamin D deficiency means that you do not have enough vitamin D in your body. Vitamin D is essential for several reasons, including maintaining healthy bones and teeth, as it helps the body absorb calcium. It also plays a vital role in supporting the immune system, brain, and nervous system. The body produces vitamin D when skin is directly exposed to sunlight. Despite abundant sunshine in India, deficiency is widespread due to factors like darker skin pigmentation (which reduces production), limited sun exposure due to lifestyle, and vegetarian diets low in vitamin D-rich foods. It can lead to bone disorders like rickets in children and osteomalacia or osteoporosis in adults.",
