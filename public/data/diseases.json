While usually a sign of a healthy immune response, a very high or persistent fever, especially in children and the elderly, can be uncomfortable and warrants medical attention to diagnose the underlying cause.",

It primarily damages the aorta—the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body—and its main branches. The inflammation can lead to narrowing (stenosis), blockage, or weakening (aneurysm) of the arteries, which can reduce blood flow to various parts of the body. It most often affects young women and teenage girls, and is sometimes called 'pulseless disease' because it can cause a weak or absent pulse in the arms.",

An apparently healthy baby begins to show symptoms around 6 months of age, followed by a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities, leading to death in early childhood.

    "description": "Zika virus disease is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, which bite during the day. Symptoms are generally mild and include fever, rash, and joint pain. However, a Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a serious concern as it can cause a severe birth defect called microcephaly (a condition where a baby's head is much smaller than expected) and other congenital abnormalities. The virus can also be transmitted through sexual contact. There is no specific treatment or vaccine currently available.",
    "symptoms": [
      "Many people infected with Zika virus won't have symptoms or will only have mild ones",
      "Mild fever and skin rash",
      "Conjunctivitis (red eyes)",
      "Muscle and joint pain",
      "Headache and general feeling of unease (malaise)",
      "Symptoms usually last for 2–7 days"
    ],
    "prevention": [
      "Protect against mosquito bites, especially during the day. Use insect repellents, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and stay in places with air conditioning or window screens",
      "Control mosquito populations by eliminating breeding sites (e.g., emptying standing water from containers)",
      "Pregnant women or those planning pregnancy should avoid traveling to areas with a risk of Zika",
      "Practice safe sex (use condoms) to prevent sexual transmission, especially if a partner has traveled to an area with Zika"
    ],
    "treatment": [
      "There is no specific medicine or vaccine for Zika virus",
      "Treat the symptoms: get plenty of rest, drink fluids to prevent dehydration, and take medicine such as acetaminophen to reduce fever and pain",
      "Avoid aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until dengue can be ruled out to reduce the risk of bleeding",
      "People infected with Zika should protect themselves from further mosquito bites during the first week of illness to prevent spreading the virus to more mosquitoes"
